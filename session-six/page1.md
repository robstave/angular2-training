# Routing

Routing is basically the ability to focus the application to a specific component
using the browsers url. By being able to manipulate the URL without forcing a reload,
we can manage the page state as well as take advantages of browser features like
history and linking.

In the beginning of SPA (Single Page Apps), they used the [hashtag](http://blog.mgm-tp.com/2011/10/must-know-url-hashtechniques-for-ajax-applications/) locator to trick the
browser into switching around the application without really causing a reload.  Going
to a url with the app might look like.

```
http://greatness.com/index.html/#
```

and subsequent states might look like

```
http://greatness.com/index.html/#/about
 
or
 
http://greatness.com/index.html/#/user?id=3&view=simple
```

With this strategy, we have a url that we can direct our browser to anytime.  
We can enforce permissions per route if we have to and use built in broswer features like bookmarking and refresh.

This is how the original angular1.x router did it out of the box. There were other routers that
were developed afterwards as more complex demands were made of the framework.

Older browsers did not handle the histories so well though and requiered an http request of some kind
to trigger a change in state.

With HTML5, browsers can now manage its histories without requests.  To utilize this, you need a modern
broswer, and a server that can support HTML5 based routing.

The Router in Angular2 is very feature rich and has gone through many revisions.  It now supports a
number of complex scenarios including parallel views, route guarding services and loading bundles on demand.

# Angular 2 Router

The main point of the router is to be able to bind a URL to a Component. 

The three main items you need for basic routing are:

 * *Routes* to map the url routes to the components (or redirects)
 * *RouterOutlet* as a component (like app-root) to render the specified component.
 * *RouterLink* directive to specify the links that will go to the router (like href)
 
## Project

We will create a small app to demonstrate routing with an app that has 3 routes:  **Home**, **about** and **users**.
Start out the project with _angular-cli_. 

```bash
ng new simple-routes 
cd simple-routes
```

Inspecting *app.module.ts* we see the http and forms are there, but no router. We will need to add this.

Router support was removed from angular-cli, so we will be doing this ourselves.
This may change, but the router was still under so much development that they removed it for the time being.

Our project will have a home, about and users so lets create those components.

```bash
ng g component home
ng g component about
ng g component users

```

So open *app.module.ts*  to add the routes and imports

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';

import {  RouterModule,  Routes } from '@angular/router';  //<---added
import {LocationStrategy, HashLocationStrategy} from '@angular/common';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';
import { UsersComponent } from './users/users.component';


const routes: Routes = [
 { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },
 { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
 { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
 { path: 'users', component: UsersComponent },
 { path: 'contactus', redirectTo: 'about' },
 ];

 
 
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    HomeComponent,
    AboutComponent,
    UsersComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes) // <-- routes
  ],
  providers: [ ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```


So we have added the route imports and a constant object that specifies our routes.

In routes:
  * _path_ specifies the the URL substring that the route applies to
  * _component_ specifies the componet that the route maps to
  * _redirect_ is optional. It is better to redirect to a route than map multiple routes to the same component.

We have added the Routes to the imports with _forRoot_ pointing to the root set of routes.
This is done only once as opposed to _forChild_ which can be done multiple times in other feature modules.
For now, just note that this our root app and we are setting these routes as a base set of routes.

For more on _forRoot_ see [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/ngmodule-faq.html#!#q-for-root).
In fact, the whole [ngModule Cookbook](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/ngmodule-faq.html) is a 
great read.




Now, lets look at *app.component.html*

```html
<div>
  <nav>
    <a>Navigation:</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a [routerLink]="['home']">Home</a></li>
      <li><a [routerLink]="['about']">About</a></li>
      <li><a [routerLink]="['users']">Users</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>

  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
```

In the template we have two things that are new.
There is a _routerLink_ directive.  Think of this as a sort of href to tell the browser what url to send to the router.
Note that it is a list. Our base url is the first item in that list.

There is also the _router-outlet_ component.  The component specified in the route will be replaced here.

This is how things are generally laid out in angular with a shell view handling navigation and a router-outlet
where the view is rendered.  In addition, angular2 router supports child routes, so that subroutes and sub outlets can be embedded. 

For now though, lets just _ng serve_ and see our appliation in action


![Simple](https://github.com/robstave/angular2-training/blob/master/session-six/images/simple1.png "Simple1")

There are three links and each routes to a different component.

In the code directory, we have a snapshot of the code up to this point as _simple-routes_.  Just npm install it.



# Adding Http


So, lets add HTTP to this. Recall the [json fake api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)?  We will use that.
This one will go pretty fast.

Paste this into *users.component.ts*

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Http, Response, URLSearchParams, Headers } from '@angular/http';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-users',
  templateUrl: './users.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./users.component.css']
})
export class UsersComponent implements OnInit {

  data: Object;
  loading: boolean;

  constructor(private http: Http) {
    this.http = http;
  }

  onError = function (e) {
    console.log("error", e);
  }

  //called unconditionally
  onComplete = function (url) {
    console.log("Completed:" + url);
  }

  makeRequest(id: number): void {

    //clear data and loading
    this.data = "";
    this.loading = false;

    let usersUrl = "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
    if (id) {
      usersUrl = usersUrl + "/" + id;
    }


    //start loading
    this.loading = true;

    //build request and subscribe to results.

    this.http.request(usersUrl)
      .subscribe((res: Response) => {
        this.data = res.json();
        this.loading = false;
      },
      (error) => this.onError(error),
      () => this.onComplete(usersUrl)
      );
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.makeRequest(null)
  }

}
```
This is the same code basically as session 5.  We imported the HTTP module
so we can query the users url at [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

When we init the component, we make the request and the results are placed in data.


 Edit *users.component.html*

```html
<h2>Users</h2>


<div *ngIf="loading">loading...</div>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Username</th>
    <th>email</th>
  </tr>
  <tr *ngFor="let user of data">
    <td>{{user.name}}</td>
    <td>{{user.username}}</td>
    <td>{{user.email}}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

We are using the ngFor directive to loop over the users and print them in the table.


![Simple2](https://github.com/robstave/angular2-training/blob/master/session-six/images/simple2.png "Simple1")

 
## Show a single user

Lets add another route to display a single user.  We would like it to display the 
user when we click on the routeLink with the users id.

Create another component.


```bash
ng generate component user
```

Edit *app.module.ts*
We should see the import of the UserComponent taken care of for us by angular-cli

```bash
const routes: Routes = [
 { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },
 { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
 { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
 { path: 'users', component: UsersComponent },
 { path: 'user/:id', component: UserComponent },
 { path: 'contactus', redirectTo: 'about' } ];

```

We will add the route with _:id_ parameter to indicate that we will be passing the id in the route.


In the *users.component.html* template, we need to add the routerLink to point to the users
component.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
   <th>Username</th>
   <th>email</th>
 </tr>
    <tr *ngFor="let user of data">
        <td><a [routerLink]="['/user', user.id]">{{user.name}}</a></td>
        <td>{{user.username}}</td>
        <td>{{user.email}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

Note that we are using "/user" rather than "user".  This is because if we do not specify the root (or relative path)
it will route to something like /users/user/3. The router can be pretty flexable.
We want the page to go to "user".  The id parameter is passed as the second item in the array.


*user.component.ts* is pretty close to the users component. You can paste it all in.

```html
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Http, Response, URLSearchParams, Headers } from '@angular/http';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  templateUrl: './user.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./user.component.css']
})
export class UserComponent implements OnInit {

  user: Object;
  loading: boolean;
  id: string;

  constructor(private http: Http, private route: ActivatedRoute) {
    this.http = http;
    route.params.subscribe(params => { this.id = params['id']; });
  }

  onError = function (e) {
    console.log("error", e);
  }

  //called unconditionally
  onComplete = function (url) {
    console.log("Completed:" + url);
  }

  makeRequest(id: string): void {

    //clear data and loading

    this.user = "";
    this.loading = false;

    let usersUrl = "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
    if (id) {
      usersUrl = usersUrl + "/" + id;
    }


    //start loading
    this.loading = true;

    //build request and subscribe to results.

    this.http.request(usersUrl)
      .subscribe((res: Response) => {

        this.user = res.json();
        this.loading = false;
      },
      (error) => this.onError(error),
      () => this.onComplete(usersUrl)
      );
  }


  ngOnInit() {
    this.makeRequest(this.id)
  }

}
```

and finally the *user.component.html* template

```html
<h2> User:{{user.name}}</h2>

<div>
  <div>Username:{{user.username}}</div>
  <div>Email:{{user.email}}</div>
  <div>Id:{{user.id}}</div>
  <div>Phone:{{user.phone}}</div>
</div>
```
